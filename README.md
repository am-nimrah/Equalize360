### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Addressed

This analysis aims to contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality) by providing insights into gender disparities and facilitating evidence-based decision-making. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we strive to identify key areas for intervention and policy formulation to advance gender equality worldwide.

## Conclusion

Through the analysis of the Gender Equality Index dataset, we have gained valuable insights into the current state of gender equality across different countries. While significant progress has been made, there are still areas that require attention and targeted interventions. By employing advanced analytics techniques, we can drive positive change and work towards achieving gender equality and empowerment for all.

## Strategies Used

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature selection to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Algorithm Selection: Experimentation with different machine learning algorithms to identify the most suitable models for predicting gender equality metrics.
- Evaluation Metrics: Utilization of R^2 score and mean squared error to assess model performance and accuracy.
- Interpretation: Analysis of algorithm outputs to identify key factors influencing gender equality and inform policy recommendations.
